This milestone was completed by: Jordan Pitters, Todor Vretenarov, and Anujan Sritharan

This "read me" file is being used to inform - There was some issues faced
in the project:

1) If the values want to be seen, run the milestone without debugging.

2) The milestone main contains a check for the CRC, and the printed validation
statements are not working correctly. The group noticed that if the CRC was
what is assumed to be valid it should print out "PASSED" twice, when it 
should be "PASSED", then "FAILED". A screenshot is to be added into the zip.
